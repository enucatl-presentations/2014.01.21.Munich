Phase-contrast imaging at 100 keV on a conventional X-ray tube
=================================================================

This project demonstrates a Talbot-Lau interferometer with edge-on illumination [#edgeon]_ 
on a conventional high-energy source. 
The edge-on configuration can achieve the large aspect ratio needed to
stop the high-energy radiation in the absorption gratings. The fabrication
of such gratings for a conventional face-on geometry would not be possible
with the current technology.
An analysis of the performance of the system and
images acquired at a tube voltage of 160 kVp
and an interferometer design energy of 100 keV are shown,
thus bringing the technique in the range of medical computed
tomography as well as material science and security applications.
